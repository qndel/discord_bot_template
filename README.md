# discord_bot_template
Flexible discord.py bot template ready to use

I've set up a system to easily test your code on a test bot to make sure everything works properly before running the actual bot.
You put test bot token in a file named "token_host"
You put the normal bot token in a file named "token_remote"
If the bot sees a file named "hostPC", it will run the "token_host", if not, it will run "token_remote".
